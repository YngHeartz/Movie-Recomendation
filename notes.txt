**Project Overview:**
Create a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. You can implement this using collaborative filtering techniques or content-based filtering.

**Features to Include:**
1. **User Input:** Allow users to input their preferences, such as favorite genres, actors, directors, etc.
2. **Movie Database:** Maintain a database of movies with attributes like genre, director, actors, release year, etc. You can use APIs like IMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb) to fetch movie data.
3. **Recommendation Engine:** Implement the recommendation algorithm based on user preferences. For example, if a user likes action movies with Tom Cruise, the system should suggest action movies starring Tom Cruise.
4. **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the system, input their preferences, and receive movie recommendations.
5. **Personalization:** Make the recommendations personalized by considering the user's past viewing history and ratings if available.

**Optional Enhancements:**
1. **Rating System:** Allow users to rate movies they've watched, and use this data to refine recommendations.
2. **Similarity Metrics:** Experiment with different similarity metrics to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
3. **Web Scraping:** If APIs don't provide enough data, consider scraping movie information from websites like IMDb.
4. **Machine Learning:** Implement machine learning algorithms for recommendation, such as matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or deep learning models.

**Libraries to Consider:**
1. **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms if you choose to go that route.
3. **Flask or Django:** For building the web interface if you decide to create a web application.
4. **Requests or BeautifulSoup:** For web scraping movie data if needed.

This project can be both educational and entertaining as you dive into the world of recommendation systems and movie data. Plus, you'll end up with a cool tool that can provide personalized movie recommendations!
